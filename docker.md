Install using the Apt repository 
Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

Set up Docker's Apt repository.

# Add Docker's official GPG key:
```docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```
# Add the repository to Apt sources:
```docker
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```
Note

If you use an Ubuntu derivative distro, such as Linux Mint, you may need to use UBUNTU_CODENAME instead of VERSION_CODENAME.

Install the Docker packages.

Latest Specific version
To install the latest version, run:
```docker
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image.
```docker
sudo docker run hello-world
```
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

To create the docker group and add your user:

Create the docker group.
```docker
sudo groupadd docker
```
Add your user to the docker group. #USER = ubuntu or ec2-user if you are using ubuntu or ec2-user as a user
```docker
sudo usermod -aG docker #USER    //change #USER to the user, ubuntu or ec2-user
```
Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

If you're running Linux in a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.

You can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:
```docker
newgrp docker
```
Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.
```docker
docker run hello-world
```
