# Below is an example of an Ansible playbook that installs different tools on designated hosts
# (`mavenserver`, `sonarserver`, `jenkinsserver`, and `tomserver`) based on the Linux distribution (Ubuntu or Red Hat). 
# The playbook uses conditional statements to determine the distribution and install the appropriate tool.

# This playbook uses the `ansible.builtin.command` module to execute a command that retrieves information about the 
# Linux distribution (`/etc/os-release`). Then, based on the result, it installs the required packages using the 
# `ansible.builtin.package` module. Adjust the package names and conditions according to your specific requirements.
