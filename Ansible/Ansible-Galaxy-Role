#1. **Install Ansible Galaxy Role:**

   #Start by installing the Ansible Galaxy roles for Apache and Nginx. You can use the `ansible-galaxy` command to install roles from the Ansible Galaxy repository.

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
   ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nginx
   ```
#These commands will download the Apache and Nginx roles created by geerlingguy, which are well-maintained and widely used.

#In this playbook, we specify that it should run on hosts belonging to the `web_servers` group. It uses the roles we installed in the previous step to install Apache and Nginx.


#2. **Create an Ansible Playbook:**

#Now, create a playbook that uses the roles to install Apache and Nginx on separate hosts. Create a YAML file, e.g., `install_web_servers.yml`, with the following content:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install Apache and Nginx
     hosts: web_servers
     become: yes  # This is to run tasks with sudo (root) privileges.

     roles:
       - geerlingguy.apache
       - geerlingguy.nginx
   ```
